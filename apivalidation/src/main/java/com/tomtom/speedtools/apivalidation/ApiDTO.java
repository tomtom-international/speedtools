/**
 * This class provides an abstract base class for JAX-B data binder classes.
 *
 * The idea is that you can use JAX-B (DTO) classes that can be treated as immutable
 * which means:
 *
 * * first a DTO must be created with a constructor (for JAXB, that will be the default
 * constructor;
 *
 * * then you can use setters to set the values of all attributes;
 *
 * * then the validate() method is called, which validates if the object is indeed
 * valid (this must be done both for incoming DTOs as well as outgoing DTOs);
 *
 * * and finally, you can use getters on the object.
 *
 * This order is mandatory and the framework checks if it is not violated (or you
 * will get runtime exceptions).
 *
 * If you do not want to treat your DTOs as immutable objects, then you should use
 * the non-default constructor for ApiDTO to indicate so. This will no longer enforce
 * these rules.
 *
 * The user of this class should make sure the JAX-B classes look something like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    public class MyDTO extends ApiDTO {
 *
 *       public void validate() {
 *           validator().start();
 *           validator.checkString(true, "name", name, minLen, maxLen);
 *           validator.done();
 *       }
 *
 *       public String getName() {
 *           beforeGet();
 *           return name;
 *       }
 *
 *       public void setName() {
 *           beforeSet();
 *           this.name = name;
 *       }
 *    }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The method call {@link ApiValidator#start()} initializes the validation process and
 * subsequent checkXXX() calls will check the value and ranges of parameters. If errors
 * are found, they are accumulated. Finally, {@link ApiValidator#done()} will throw an
 * {@link com.tomtom.speedtools.apivalidation.exceptions.ApiBadRequestException} if errors
 * were found. The exception contains all errors in a structured format, which will normally
 * be passed back to the caller as a 400 (Bad Request) status, with a JSON body containing
 * the error list.
 *
 * The advantage of this type of validation over other frameworks is that it accumulates
 * ALL API parameter validations before an exception is thrown.
 *
 * This allows the caller to mark ALL offending fields at once. As the result message contains
 * the allowed values, or value ranges as well, in a structured format, these can be easily
 * shown as feedback to the user.
 *
 * The framework was originally designed to work in a WEB and mobile based environment, where
 * a user enters all sorts of details and a single validation call allows the client to mark
 * all offending fields.
