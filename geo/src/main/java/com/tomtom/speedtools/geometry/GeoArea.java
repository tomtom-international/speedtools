/**
 * A geo area is an expression which has the following format:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     GeoArea      := Primitive
 *                  |  Inverse
 *                  |  Union
 *                  |  Difference
 *
 *     Primitive    := GeoRectangle
 *                  |  GeoCircle
 *
 *     Inverse      := invert(GeoArea)
 *
 *     Union        := add(GeoArea, GeoArea)
 *
 *     Difference   := subtract(GeoArea, GeoArea)
 *
 *     Intersection := intersect(GeoArea, GeoArea)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Primitives are specified using GeoPoint objects, which can contain latitude/longitude values. As latitudes/longitudes
 * do not project easily to a Carthesian coordinates, the operations for union, intersect, contains, etc. are subject to
 * the following known restrictions:
 *
 * They are only accurate for relatively small areas, such as 200x200km.
 *
 * They are may do NOT work properly around the 180th degree longitude (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian).
 *
 * Definitions of operators:
 *
 * Union({1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}) == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
 *
 * Difference({ 1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}) == {1, 2}
 *
 * Intersection({ 1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}) == {3}
