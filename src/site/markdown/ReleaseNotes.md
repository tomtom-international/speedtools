Release Notes
----

### 3.2.20-3.2.21

* Updated dependencies.

### 3.2.13-3.2.19

* Updated POM dependencies.

* Fixed Jackson (and Jetty) vulnerability.

* Updated copyright to TomTom NV.

### 3.2.12

* Updated dependencies in `pom.xml`. This includes an update of the MongoDB driver, which
now serializes `DBObject` with a different `$date` format.

### 3.2.11

* Added `getHeading` for `GeoLine`.

### 3.2.10

* Changed type of parameter for `GeoRectangle.expand()` to double to allow sub-meter values.

* Added `MathUtils.wrapValueToWithinLimits()` to limit values between `[]-limit, limit)`. 
 
### 3.2.9

* Properties starting or ending with 'secret' or 'password' are now never shown at startup 
(case-insenstive). 

### 3.2.8

* Allowed default value to be `{empty}` (or any other string). The `{...}` are matched properly now.
Assigning the null string means the environment varibale is left undefined, so `${X:=}` would leave `X` 
undefined if the environment variable was not set, leading to a start-up error (which is a good thing),

### 3.2.7

* Added the ability to use environment variables in property values. You can now use the sytax
`property=${VAR:=default}` to use the environment variable `VAR` in a property value, with a 
default value of `default`, if the environment variables wasn't set.

### 3.2.6

* Included `elevationMeters` in remaining `Geo`-classes. All operations now support elevations, including
translation and length calculations. 

* Geo-objects like lines, polylines, rectangles etc. now always have either no elevation at all, or all
their points or corners do have an elevation.  

* Added unit tests to test elevation behavior.

### 3.2.5

* Included `elevationMeters` in `Geo`-classes, so `GeoPoint`s can be 3D. If the elevation is omitted, the
point is considered 2D. 

* Includes moving to Scala 2.12.4 and Akka libraries compiled for Scala 2.12.

### 3.2.4

* Updated dependencies to latest from Maven Central.

* Includes moving to Scala 2.12.4 and Akka libraries compiled for Scala 2.12.

### 3.2.3

* Minor fixes.

### 3.2.2

* Added three properties to control the behavior fo the `MongoDBTraceFetcher` better:

    * `MongoDBTrace.fetcherThreadSleepMsecs = 250`: Specifies how fast the trace fetcher schedules retrieving
    additional traces to fill its buffer.
     
    * `MongoDBTrace.fetcherThreadSleepAfterExceptionMsecs = 5000`: Specifies how long the trace fetcher will
    wait and sit and do nothing when a (database) exception occurs.
    
    * `MongoDBTrace.fetcherQueueMaxSize = 500`: Specifies hoe many trace events the trace fetcher will buffer
    at most, before stopping collectin more events.

* Added `SecurityHelper` methods to get `Principal` name for authenticated sessions, for convenience.
 
* Made `SessionManager.createSecurityContext` public, because it's needed by a security manager implementation.

* Removed `AuthenticationScheme` enum and replaced it with a generic `String` implementation to
be extensible to include one-time-passwords, OAuth, etc.

### 3.2.1

* Removed automatic binding of `SecurityInterceptor`. Needs to be done explicitly by
caller now in a Guice module: `binder.bind(SecurityInterceptor.class).in(Singleton.class)`, 
where `binder` is an injected Guice binder. If the bidnding is nor performed, no authentication 
is enforced; otherwise it is by default enforced on all URLs.

* Important: The SMS module has been rewritten to use the Resteasy 3.x client interface, but
the APIs seems to be broken. Need to be fixed. 

### 3.2.0

* This release is not fully compatible with previous releases: the `Tracer` 
interfaces have changed.

* The `tracer` module has been places at top-level, rather than under `mongodb`. This
means you need to include the `tracer` separately in your POMs, and the package names
have changed to `com.tomtom.speedtools.tracer`.

### 3.1.0 - 3.1.1

* This release is not fully compatible with previous releases due to an Akka upgrade, 
which has deprecated the use of typed actors.

* Implemented full security for REST APIs in module `rest.security`.

* Updated Akka dependencies to 2.5.3.
 
* Remove module `akka`, which has become superfluous. Move the `Duration` utilities from 
`AkkaUtils` to `core/time`.

* Removed `TokenBucket` class entirely. This was more of a utility class.

* Removed all classes for typed actors, like `ActorFactory`, `TypedActorContext`.

* Removed `RootActor` class. 

* Sorted dependencies in POMs.

### 3.0.26

* Updated POM dependencies.

### 3.0.25

* Removed secret token from POM.

* Fixed issues from code review with Codacy.

* Fixed copyright messages for 2017.

### 3.0.24

* Fixed issue with Guice test.

* Added ability to create immutable `ApiListDTO` collection.

### 3.0.23

* Updated dependencies of Maven POM to latest versions.

### 3.0.22

* Introduced Travis CI and Coveralls in POM and root directory for fully
automated CI and test coverage and added badges to `README.md`.

### 3.0.21

* Updated `com.tomtom.speedtools.rest.ResourceProcessor` to use the new RESTEasy `AsyncResponse` 
and `@Suspended` interfaces. The old interfaces `AsynchronousResponse` and `@Suspend` are still 
supported, but have been marked `@Deprecated` and support will be removed at some point.

### 3.0.20

* Changed from APT to Markdown format for all documentation.

* Updated dependencies of JBoss RESTEasy and Maven plugins.

* Enabled JavaDoc for all modules in Maven site.

### 3.0.19

* Removed **ApiValidator.resetValidator()** and replaced with an indication
  of whether the object is immutable or not. Immutable objects get additional
  checks and are automatically validated when a getter is executed.

* Added **ApiValidator.resetValidator()**.

* Updated POM dependencies.

### 3.0.17

### 3.0.6

* Made **ApiDTO.validate()** public to validate polymorph objects.

### 3.0.3

* Made **ApiDataBInder.validate()** public to allow validating different inherited binders easily.

* Added **javax.ws.rs** exceptions to **GeneralExceptionMapper**.
