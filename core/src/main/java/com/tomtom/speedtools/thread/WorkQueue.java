/**
 * This class creates a pool of worker threads that will execute workload tasks. The amount of actual threads is
 * limited, as well as the workload queue.
 *
 * To use this class, you should create a WorkQueue with a maximum number of work packages for the work queue. Some of
 * the worker threads are started (and stand-by) immediately after creating the WorkQueue.
 *
 * After that, you can add workload (which is really an instance of a Runnable) to the work queue by using
 * startOrWait(workLoad). This call will add the workload if the queue is not filled up yet, or wait until there is room
 * to add the workload.
 *
 * You can use waitUntilFinished() to wait until the entire workload queue is processed (and all worker threads are done
 * processing). Or you can check whether processing is done with isEmptyAndFinished().
 *
 * If worker threads throw exceptions, these are caught and stored in a list which can be retrieved by
 * getRuntimeExceptions(). The worker thread that processed workload throwing such an exception is simply returned to
 * the thread pool ready to process the next piece of workload.
 *
 * To shutdown all the worker threads, use scheduleShutdown(). This will schedule a shutdown of all worker threads after
 * they have finished processing their workload. After this call, the only valid calls left is getRuntimeExceptions().
 *
 * Important: This class itself is NOT thread safe: only 1 thread should feed one particular instance of WorkQueue at a
 * time.
