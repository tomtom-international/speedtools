/**
 * This class is used to rate limit writes to, say, MongoDB reads/writes. It's handy if the calling code can do bulk
 * write operations through the limiter, which rate-limits how fast they happen. Note you can disable the rate limiter
 * by setting the frequency to 0.
 *
 * The math is as follows (mod some conversions between seconds and nano-seconds):
 * <pre>
 *  After n samples, we can computer Ri as the "immediate rate" like:
 *      Ri = (n-1) / (timestamp - timestamp(0))
 *  which is essentially the 1/average interval.
 *
 *  Given a target rate, Rt ("maxFreqHz"), we can compute it like:
 *      Rt = n / (S + (timestamp - timestamp(0))
 *
 *  S here is how long to sleep before we invoke the next operation.  Solving for S:
 *      S = n / Rt - (timestamp - timestamp(0))
 * </pre>
