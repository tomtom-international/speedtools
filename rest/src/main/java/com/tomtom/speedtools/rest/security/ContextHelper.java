/**
 * Utility methods in this class should be used whenever a context object needs to be retrieved from RestEasy.
 *
 * RestEasy stores context data in thread locals, hence context objects are only available to the thread invoking the
 * JAX-RS resource method. When injecting context objects via annotations, a proxy is injected that only resolves when
 * being accessed on the same thread. When requesting context objects via the RestEasy API, then RestEasy will return
 * {@code null} when not accessed on the same thread.
 *
 * The utilities in this class will throw whenever a requested context object cannot be retrieved because the utility
 * method is not called on the same thread as the one that invoked the JAX-RS resource method. This ensures that
 * programming mistakes are caught as early as possible.
